#Project Phases

Check all the branches to see how the project is growing (Master is the less advanced branch).

#Installation Requirements

- Nodejs, MongoDB, installed.
- After cloning the project, don't forget npm install.

# Run the Project

Open 2 terminal windows and go to the project folder.

Node.js Backend: npm start
Angular 2 Frontend: npm run build

For production:

npm run build:prod

--> A process should start, when it finishes, just run npm start and the project will load (with dev tools you can see the bundle.js file is only a few KB)
